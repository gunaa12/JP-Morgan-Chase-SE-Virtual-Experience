# JP-Morgan-Chase-SE-Virtual-Experience

Familiarized myself with JPMorgan Chase frameworks and applied my technical skills to a hypothetical request by analyzing and visualizing data in a new way. Through this program, I got to learn how to:
* Interface with a stock price data feed
* Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools
* Display data visually for traders
